"""petcam brain: a command-driven pet daemon. Heist flavor  - the
pet is the crew's *spotter* at HQ, watching the mark's screen (the feed).

Watches the petcam receiver (/state) and drives the Omarchy pet:
  - poses the pet based on feed health (live / stale / no frames)
  - speaks a bubble when the feed state changes (e.g. "in on the mark's screen")
  - executes commands from a control file so an agent (or you) can make the
    pet act on the other machine without touching the daemon:
        echo '{"cmd":"think","text":"..."}'  > petcam/cmd.json   (talk)
        echo '{"cmd":"click","x":640,"y":360}' > petcam/cmd.json (phase 2)
        echo '{"cmd":"loot"}'               > petcam/cmd.json   (lift intel)

Runs on the 5090. Talks to the pet only through the `omarchy-shell` CLI, so
the pet stays a stock Omarchy plugin  - nothing custom is patched into it.
